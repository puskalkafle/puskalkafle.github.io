# npm resolution error report

While resolving: puskal-kafle-website@1.0.0
Found: react@16.14.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^16.13.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^17.0.1" from simple-react-lightbox@3.5.4
node_modules/simple-react-lightbox
  simple-react-lightbox@"^3.5.4" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
